# Syntax: Standard table, sub_table,experiment(mode)[  experiment(mode)]

# MIP table: As specified in the standard table
# sub_table: Exactly as given in the MIP table (but only
#            the first 10 character are significant).
#            If none, then don't forget the ','.
# experiment: Experiment_id attribute (multiples WITHOUT ',').
# (mode): keyword or period of the current netCDF file belongs to.
#         If more then a single one, then separate by '|'.
# Note: No space between 'experiment' and '(mode)'.
# Definitions:
#       'regular': Full time check of each record.
#       'disable': No time check at all.
#        'orphan': No time check across files or experiments (1st rec),
#                  full time check of all other records.
# 'date_0-date_1': Period of an experiment. Format: DRS syntax
# singular values: Integers denote arbitrary sequence of years,
#                  prefix 'N' indicates the number of required records.
#          '+int': Period length of 'int' years from the begin given
#                  by the first time record.
# Empty lines are ignored. Spaces are insignificant, except for
# the MIP table and the sub-table string.
# Continued lines require ':' in front of a new line line.
