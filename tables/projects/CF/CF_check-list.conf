# Check-list applying to the CF-1.4 Convention
# path: /yours/QC-DKRZ/tables/projects/CF/CF_check-list.conf

#   Description:
#   Any text following the # char is a comment.
#   Each deteced incident is handled by a directive on its own.
#   Directives are specified by tokens within groups indicated by braces {}.

#  Brace Operation:
#  A nested brace inherits the contents of the one it is embedded. The
#  hierarchy of braces is tree-like with unlimited number of parallel
#  branches as well as vertical branching. Thus, the tip of a branch
#  inherits every item from the parent down the crotches to the root.
#  The braces {} of the lowest level may be omitted as well as a comma
#  around braces. Each higher-level branch, i.e. contents of a brace,
#  is a specialisation to its parent. A brace may contain multiple
#  comma-separated items. If the L-value, i.e. the word 'key'
#  in 'key=value', is identical to a lower level one, then the
#  lower one is not inherited. Inheritance of an item may also be inhibited by
#  the macro "D(item). The macro is applied solely to L-values.
#  The hierarchy of braces is eventually expanded into unrelated strings.
#  Example:
#     simple:  given: a,{b,c},{d,e},f
#             result: 'a,f', 'a,b,c,f', 'd,e,a,f'
#  elaborate: given: a,b=1{x=v{D(x),y,b=2}},{u,v},w
#             result: 'a,b=1,w', 'x=v,a,b=1,w', 'y,b=2,a,w', 'u,v,a,b=1,w,'

#   Key words: L1, L2, L3, D, EM, flag, var, V=value, R=record
#   Level:    L1 Notify incidents. Continue unrestricted.
#             L2 Continue checking to the end of the file. Then,
#                lock processing of the current variable.
#             L3 Stop after completion of meta-data checks. Lock
#                processing of current variable.
#             L4 Stop immediately and shutdown the QC session (no locks).
#   Flag:     Should match those in the check-list.
#   Task:     Email notification (EM), discard the check/test (D)
#   Variable: A list of comma-separated acronyms of variables; directive is
#             only applied to the variable(s).
#   Value:    Constraining value, e.g. {flag,D,V=0,var} discards a test
#             for variable var only if value=0
#   Record:   Record(s), i.e. data at a time value, may be excluded from checking.
#             Single records as well as ranges, e.g. 1-12, may be provided.
#             Note: counting of records starts with number one.
#   Default: {L1}, {L2,EM}, {L3,EM}

#   Force unique behaviour (e.g. for testing). Please, unmark the comment #.
#   NOTE_ALWAYS {group1}, {group2}, . . .
# NOTE_ALWAYS {L1}, {10,D}

#   Leading characters permitted for flags (besides a digit).
